        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>My favorite hobby is journaling. I love journaling becuase to me it helps me relax. In my journal I always write anything I feel like, to me I like it becuase I cannot feel judged. I also love the way I decorate and colorify everything in my journal. I always have themes for each entry I write and each time they are different. Usually many people only use journaling for collecting ideas or observations, maybe even just things to help you remember certin events. Though for me, I am not only using it for themes and reminders, I also use it to write what I feel. Meaning I like to use it as a diary and journal. journaling helps me mentally as well. I can write to any extent I want and my favorite part is reflecting upon my past and remembering how I felt in past time. Though journaling is not nessesary a hobby, it is still one of my favorite things. That is why to me I think that journaling is a spiffing thing to do and have which is why I love it.</p>
